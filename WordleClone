#currently it doesn't generate a random word i.e. requires target word input, 
#doesn't tell you if word does not exist or if it's repeated 
#doesn't check if the word being typed is >5 words (doesn't stop you from doing so)
#only want one letter/color (G,Y,N) to show up for repeated letters
#need game ends/breaks
