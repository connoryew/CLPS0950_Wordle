**Project Proposal:** Our CLPS0950 Final Project will consist of creating a Wordle clone, wherein users will be able to interact with our code as they do the NYT Wordle. Users will enter up to six 5-letter guesses at a randomly selected word, and our code will return the guess with YELLOW for any letters that are in the word but not in their correct locations, GREEN for letters where both are true, and GREY if the letter is not located within the target word. The purpose of the game is to correctly guess the random 5-letter word, yielding an all-green returned guess. As part of this project, we will also create a Wordle interface that mimics the NYT Wordle to make it more user friendly and enjoyable to play.

**Acknowledgements:** 
We got our list of possible of Wordle guesses and words from the New York Times game website and used the random, pygame, and string modules to run our game. Read more about pygame here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
