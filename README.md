**Project Proposal:** Our CLPS0950 Final Project will consist of creating a Wordle clone, wherein users will be able to interact with our code as they do the NYT Wordle. Users will enter a word, and our code will return the word with yellow for any letters that are in the word but not in their correct locations, green if both are true, and grey if the letter is not located within the target word. We will also create a Wordle interface that mimics the NYTWordle to make it more user friendly and enjoyable to play.
